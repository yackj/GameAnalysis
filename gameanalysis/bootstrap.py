    Parameters
    ----------
    game : SampleGame
        The sample game to bootstrap the function value over.
    function : f(Game) -> float or f(Game) -> [float]
        The function of the game to compute. It must be pickleable unless
        processes is 1, and it must return either a float or an iterable of
        floats. If an iterable of floats, this bootstrap all indices of the
        return value independently.
    num_resamples : int
        The number of bootstrap samples. Higher will take longer but also give
        better accuracy.
    num_returned : int
        The number of float values your function returns.
    percentiles : int or [int]
        The percentiles to compute on the resulting data in [0, 100]. Standard
        percentiles are 95, or [2.5, 97.5]. By default, return all samples.
    processes : int (optional)

        number of cores.

    -------
    bootstrap_percentiles : ndarray
        An ndarray of the percentiles from bootstrapping. The shape will depend
        on the number of percentiles and the number of values returned from
